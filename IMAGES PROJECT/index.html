<h1> Types of Images</h1>
<p> The first type of image is the GIF. GIFs are a good resource for simple graphics because of their low file size. However, the downside being that they are restricted to 256 colors. This is not eniugh to make a image look like a real lifr scene.
<p> The next type of iamge is the JPG. JPG are a artists best bet when working with photographs contaning complex images.
<P> The last of type of image is the PNG. which is good because it gives you the most amount of availble colors.
